# Windows-Loudness-Equalization-toggle
Windows loudness equalization is audio enhancement that uses understanding of human hearing to reduce perceived volume differences. 

Some examples: High volume explosions in the movie are tuned down and low volume dialogues turned up automatically, balanced audio of footsteps/low volume effects in games (CS:GO for instance),loud weapon sounds, VOIP etc. 

This application creates a TOGGLE KEY, to enable and disable this feature as needed by pressing just one key, since you wonâ€™t want to use it while you listen to music and other content where audio levels are preferred to be unbalanced.
